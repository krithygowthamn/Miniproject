## Title of the Project
Smart Skin detection system using machine learning

## About
Skin detection is essential for applications in computer vision, human-computer
interaction, and medical diagnostics. This paper presents a smart skin detection system
leveraging machine learning (ML) to improve accuracy across diverse conditions, overcoming
limitations of traditional methods that struggle with variations in skin tone and illumination.

## Features
The current skin detection system can be further improved through several advancements that
will increase its accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency in diverse real-world scenarios. These
future enhancements aim to address current limitations, such as handling diverse skin tones,
background complexity, real-time performance, and adaptability to dynamic environments.

## Requirements
Skin Tone Detection: Accurately identify and classify various skin tones.
Real-time Analysis: Provide immediate results through live image processing.
Environment Adaptation: Function reliably under different lighting conditions.
Camera Integration: Support integration with various camera hardware.
Mobile and Web App Support: Accessible via smartphones and web applications.
Data Privacy: Ensure secure handling and processing of user data.
Reporting and Analytics: Generate detailed reports on skin type, health, or conditions.
Multi-language Support: Provide accessibility in different languages.
Custom Recommendations: Offer skincare or dermatological advice based on analysis.
